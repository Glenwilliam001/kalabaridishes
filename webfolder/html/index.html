          <h4>About Kalabari Kingdom</h4>
          <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 2">
            The Kalabari Kingdom is a traditional state located in the Niger
            Delta region of Nigeria, specifically in Rivers State. Its history
            is rich and complex, intertwined with the broader history of the
            Niger Delta region. Origins: The Kalabari people are believed to
            have migrated from Ijaw communities in the Niger Delta region. They
            are part of the Ijaw ethnic group, which is one of the largest
            ethnic groups in the Niger Delta. The Kalabari settled along the
            banks of the New Calabar River, from which their name is derived.
            Formation of the Kingdom: The Kalabari Kingdom was established in
            the 17th century. Its formation was influenced by trade
            relationships with European traders, particularly the Portuguese and
            later the British. The Kalabari were active participants in the
            transatlantic slave trade, exchanging goods and captives with
            European traders. Social Structure: The Kalabari Kingdom was
            organized into a hierarchical social structure with a monarch,
            titled the Amayanabo, at the top. Below the monarch were titled
            chiefs, followed by various sub-chiefs and elders. The society was
            also organized into various guilds and societies, each with its own
            functions and responsibilities. Economic Activities: The Kalabari
            people were skilled traders and fishermen. They engaged in trade
            with neighboring communities and European traders, exchanging goods
            such as palm oil, ivory, and slaves. Fishing was also a significant
            economic activity due to the kingdom's location along the river.
